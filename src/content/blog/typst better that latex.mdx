# Math Equations

## Inline Math

The Pythagorean theorem is given by $$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $$.

## Block Math

Here is the equation for the area of a circle:

$$
A = \pi r^2
$$

And here is a more complex equation:

$$
E = mc^2
$$

## Math with Fractions and Roots

The quadratic formula is:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

The square root of $$ x $$ is:

$$
\sqrt{x}
$$

## Math with Matrices

Here is an example of a matrix:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{bmatrix}
$$

## Math with Summations

The sum of the first $$ n $$ natural numbers is:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
$$
